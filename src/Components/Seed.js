        Sounds pretty easy, right? I mean c’mon, we’re all creatives here. How hard can it be to carve out a few minutes to draw a lil’ something each day?`

I knew I should be, and I told myself I would, over and over. But somehow, the hours and then the days would slip by and I wouldn’t draw a single line.
        I’d get busy with all the other things I had to do. I’d get overwhelmed not knowing what to draw. I’d be afraid I would draw something terrible and end up feeling worse. But a lot of times, I’d just choose not to draw because it was easier. I’ll do it tomorrow…
        Inktober was the kick in the butt I needed. I forget now exactly which year it was, but the year I found out about Inktober marked a major shift in my drawing output. I saw a tweet about it and thought, “Yes! This is what I need! This will give me the motivation and accountability to actually draw every day!”

        child: ` And surprisingly, it did. Did I draw every single day that first Inktober? No. I missed a couple days in the beginning. It wasn’t perfect. But having the ongoing motivation, and knowing that I was supposed to be posting on Instagram each day, made me jump back on the drawing wagon way quicker than I had before. All in all, I only missed a few days. It was more than I had ever drawn. But more importantly, it was the most consistent I had ever drawn.
        A funny thing happened while I was going through that first monthly challenge. I started to want to draw each day. Once I had gotten over the hump of the first week or so, and had dragged myself to my sketchbook for days in a row, something clicked in my brain that made me start to crave drawing. I no longer had to work as hard to convince myself to draw. I just wanted to.`,
